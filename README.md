# heart-disease-prediction
I have developed a model for predicting Heart Disease, which involves a classification problem. For this task, we utilized the Logistic Regression algorithm. The model takes into account various features such as BMI, Smoking, Alcohol Drinking, Stroke, Physical Health, Mental Health, Difficulty Walking, Sex, Age Category, Race, Diabetic condition, Physical Activity, General Health, Sleep Time, Asthma, Kidney Disease, and Skin Cancer. It predicts whether a customer has a heart disease or not. Additionally, I have created a user-friendly GUI for this purpose.
